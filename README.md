# pyportscanner
I built a basic port scanner with banner-grabbing and thread functions few months ago as my first project, and decided to post it here too.
=======
Port scanner with built in banner-grabbing and thread functionality.

Currently, verbose mode outputs all ports in the range(default is 1-10000) to the terminal. this feature will likely be changed to offer better visibility.

I am also aware that banner grabbing function has some 'hiccups' on select ports. I will release a patch soon to fix these said 'hiccups'.

The help menu explains the program in it's whole pretty well, but if you have any problems or questions, feel free to reach out to me.

There are plans to add more functionality such as UDP scanning, OS detection, and more but I am unsure as to when will these features be added since I am working on multiple projects currently.
